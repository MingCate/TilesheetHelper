# TilesheetHelper
This is a work in progress tool to streamline the Terraria tilesheet creation process for spriters while sacrificing minimum detail. Currently, it functions as a command prompt tool - you drag a properly formatted base section of a generic tilesheet (In a 1x1 pixel tilesheet - the upperleftmost 53 x 44 area) onto the .exe, and it will splice together those sprites to create a tilesheet that is usable ingame. Dragging *that* tilesheet onto the .exe will duplicate the tiles into an underlay that a "dirtmerge" overlay can then be pasted on top of. And dragging *that* underlay onto the .exe will turn it into a "dirtmerge" overlay with the texture of the tile you created. You will need to supply a DirtMerge.png for it to compile, this can be any image of 144 x 135 proportions. This file is the template the program uses when creating "dirtmerges" with new textures. The darkest color in this supplied DirtMerge.png will be interpreted as an outline, the lighter color (or colors) will determine the shape.
While technically functioning, it is a little confusing to use. I am currently working on a complete overhaul of the program to have a UI interface instead.
